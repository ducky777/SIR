SIR (Self-Iterating Retriever) is a lightweight, cost-effective system for multi-hop question answering. SIR enables your retrieval system to incrementally gather information across multiple retrieval steps to answer complex queries that require connecting information from different sources.

## Requirements
python>=3.10

## Installation
`pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ü§ñ Our Specialized Lightweight Model

The core advantage of SIR is our specialized, compact model specifically optimized for multi-hop retrieval:

- **Small & Efficient**: Only 363M parameters (compared to 7B+ for LLM-based retrievers)
- **Extended Context**: 8K token context window fine tuned from `"embaas/sentence-transformers-e5-large-v2"`
- **Cost-Effective**: 10-20x cheaper to run than larger models with similar performance
- **Fast Inference**: Low latency even on CPU, no GPU required for reasonable performance
- **Fine-Tuned Specifically**: Trained on diverse multi-hop reasoning tasks to connect information efficiently

**‚≠êÔ∏è Recommended**: Use our specialized model for optimal performance:
