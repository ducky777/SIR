SIR (Self-Iterating Retriever) is a lightweight, cost-effective system for multi-hop question answering. SIR enables your retrieval system to incrementally gather information across multiple retrieval steps to answer complex queries that require connecting information from different sources.

## Requirements
python>=3.10

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ü§ñ Our Specialized Lightweight Model

The core advantage of SIR is our specialized, compact model specifically optimized for multi-hop retrieval:

- **Small & Efficient**: Only 363M parameters (compared to 7B+ for LLM-based retrievers)
- **Extended Context**: 8K token context window fine tuned from `"embaas/sentence-transformers-e5-large-v2"`
- **Fine-Tuned Specifically**: Trained on diverse multi-hop reasoning tasks to connect information efficiently

**‚≠êÔ∏è Recommended**: Use our specialized model for optimal performance:

## Quick Start
`python demo.py`

## Input Format
```python
context = "".join(f"\n{j + 1}. {s}" for j, s in enumerate(memory_documents))
query_with_context = f"Query: {query}\n\nContext:\n{context}"
```
