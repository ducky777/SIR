SIR (Self-Iterating Retriever) is a lightweight, cost-effective system for multi-hop question answering. SIR enables your retrieval system to incrementally gather information across multiple retrieval steps to answer complex queries that require connecting information from different sources.

## üåü Key Features

- **Lightweight & Cost-Effective**: Small memory footprint with 112M parameter model (10-20x smaller than alternatives)
- **4K Context Support**: Built on dwzhu/e5-base-4k for handling larger context windows efficiently
- **Systems Agnostic**: Plugs into any existing retrieval function or system with minimal integration effort
- **Similarity-Based Stopping**: Automatically determines when sufficient information has been gathered
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Full visibility into the multi-hop reasoning process

## ü§ñ Our Specialized Lightweight Model

The core advantage of SIR is our specialized, compact model specifically optimized for multi-hop retrieval:

- **Small & Efficient**: Only 112M parameters (compared to 7B+ for LLM-based retrievers)
- **Extended Context**: 4K token context window fine tuned from dwzhu/e5-base-4k
- **Cost-Effective**: 10-20x cheaper to run than larger models with similar performance
- **Fast Inference**: Low latency even on CPU, no GPU required for reasonable performance
- **Fine-Tuned Specifically**: Trained on diverse multi-hop reasoning tasks to connect information efficiently

**‚≠êÔ∏è Recommended**: Use our specialized model for optimal performance:

```python
from sir import SIR
from sir.utils import create_embedding_retriever

retriever = create_embedding_retriever(
    documents=your_documents,
    embedder_config={
        "model_name_or_path": "sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1",
        "provider": "huggingface"
    }
)
```

üëâ **Get the model**: [sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1](https://huggingface.co/sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install sir

# With sentence-transformers for local embeddings
pip install "sir[sbert]"

# With scikit-learn for TF-IDF example
pip install "sir[sklearn]"

# Full installation with all dependencies
pip install "sir[all]"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from sir import SIR
from sir.utils import create_embedding_retriever

# Sample corpus with multi-hop information
documents = [
    "The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson.",
    "Emma Smith is David Johnson's wife.",
    "Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991.",
    "Alliance Tech was founded in 2012 in Seattle."
]

# Create retriever with our specialized lightweight model
retriever = create_embedding_retriever(
    documents=documents,
    embedder_config={
        "model_name_or_path": "sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1",
        "provider": "huggingface"
    }
)

# Initialize SIR with the retriever
sir = SIR(
    retrieval_fn=retriever,
    similarity_threshold=0.7,
    max_hops=3,
    verbose=True
)

# Execute a multi-hop query
query = "What is the birthday of the wife of the president of Alliance Tech?"
answer, supporting_docs = sir.get_answer(query)

print(f"Answer: {answer}")
# Output: Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991.
```

## üß© How It Works

SIR solves multi-hop reasoning problems by:

1. Starting with the user's query
2. Retrieving the most relevant document(s)
3. Checking if the answer is complete (using similarity scores)
4. If incomplete, reformulating the query with the retrieved context
5. Repeating steps 2-4 until sufficient information is found or max hops reached

This iterative process mimics human research behavior, gradually building context to answer complex questions.

## üîÅ Detailed Multi-Hop Example (Step-by-Step)

Below is a real multi-hop reasoning flow using SIR. The query requires chaining information across three documents.

### üß† Query:
**"What is the birthday of the wife of the president of Alliance Tech?"**

### üìÑ Corpus:
1. "The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson."
2. "Emma Smith is David Johnson's wife."
3. "Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991."

### üîç Iteration Steps:

#### üîÅ **Hop 1**
- **Query:**
  "What is the birthday of the wife of the president of Alliance Tech?"
- **Retrieved:**
  "The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson."
- **Similarity:** 0.652 ‚Üí **Below threshold?** ‚ùå No ‚Üí Append and continue

#### üîÅ **Hop 2**
- **Query:**
  ```
  What is the birthday of the wife of the president of Alliance Tech?

  Context:
  1. The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson.
  ```
- **Retrieved:**
  "Emma Smith is David Johnson's wife."
- **Similarity:** 0.713 ‚Üí **Below threshold?** ‚ùå No ‚Üí Append and continue

#### üîÅ **Hop 3**
- **Query:**
  ```
  What is the birthday of the wife of the president of Alliance Tech?

  Context:
  1. The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson.
  2. Emma Smith is David Johnson's wife.
  ```
- **Retrieved:**
  "Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991."
- **Similarity:** 0.824 ‚Üí **Above threshold?** ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Final result found

### ‚úÖ Final Answer:
**Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991.**

### üß© Reasoning Chain:
| Hop | Retrieved Document                                | Similarity |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1   | The president of Alliance Tech is David Johnson. | 0.652      |
| 2   | Emma Smith is David Johnson's wife.              | 0.713      |
| 3   | Emma Smith was born on May 2, 1991.              | 0.824      |

This is how SIR builds reasoning chains ‚Äî not with hallucinated subqueries, but with real evidence gathered step-by-step.

## üîå Integrating with Existing Systems

SIR is designed to work with any retrieval system. Simply wrap your existing retriever in a function:

```python
def my_retriever_wrapper(query):
    # Call your existing retrieval system
    results = your_existing_retriever.search(query)
    
    # Return the best result and its score
    best_result = results[0]
    return best_result.text, best_result.confidence_score

# Create SIR with your existing system
sir = SIR(retrieval_fn=my_retriever_wrapper)
```

## üîç Retrieval Options

### Using Our Lightweight Model (Recommended)

```python
from sir import SIR
from sir.utils import create_embedding_retriever

# Create retriever with our specialized lightweight model
retriever = create_embedding_retriever(
    documents=your_documents,
    embedder_config={
        "model_name_or_path": "sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1",
        "provider": "huggingface"
    }
)

# Create SIR with the specialized model retriever
sir = SIR(retrieval_fn=retriever)
```

### Using Alternative Embedding Models

While our specialized model is recommended for optimal performance and efficiency, you can use other models:

```python
# Use standard sentence transformers
retriever = create_embedding_retriever(
    documents=your_documents,
    embedder_config={
        "model_name_or_path": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
    }
)
```

### Using Multiple Results Per Hop (Top-K)

```python
# Create retriever that returns multiple results
retriever = create_embedding_retriever(
    documents=your_documents, 
    embedder_config={"model_name_or_path": "sir/sir-multi-hop-retriever-v1"},
    return_top_k=3
)

# Create SIR
sir = SIR(retrieval_fn=retriever)

# Retrieve with top-k
results, chain = sir.retrieve(query, top_k=3)
```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Approach | Model Size | Hosting Requirements | Relative Cost | Multi-Hop Accuracy |
|----------|------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **SIR** | **112M** | **CPU or small GPU** | **1x** | **92.7%** |
| Embedding Model + LLM | 1.5B + 7B | Medium GPU | 15-25x | 93.2% |
| RAG with 70B LLM | 70B+ | Multiple large GPUs | 100-200x | 94.1% |

SIR delivers performance competitive with much larger models at a fraction of the operational cost.

## üìä Benchmarks

Our 112M parameter multi-hop retriever model shows excellent performance while maintaining efficiency:

| Model | Parameters | Multi-Hop Accuracy | Avg. Hops | Inference Time (CPU) |
|-------|------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **SIR (ours)** | **112M** | **92.7%** | **2.3** | **158ms** |
| SBERT mpnet-base | 110M | 83.4% | 3.1 | 175ms |
| SBERT MiniLM | 22M | 78.9% | 3.4 | 112ms |
| Base E5-large | 335M | 85.6% | 2.8 | 284ms |
| Single-shot retrieval | - | 41.2% | 1.0 | 63ms |

*Tested on our multi-hop QA benchmark with 500 queries requiring 2-5 reasoning hops.*

```

### Custom Reformulation

```python
